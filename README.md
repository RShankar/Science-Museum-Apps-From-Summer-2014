##Science-Museum-Apps-From-Summer-2014
====================================
A group of 31 high school students worked in groups of 3 or 4 during summer 2014 during a 3-week intensive course and developed Apps useful to a science museum. We collaborated with the Museum of Discovery and Science (MODS) in Ft. Lauderdale, FL for this. Our students were given tours of the exhibits and unlimited access as they evolved their ideas and focused in on an exhibit or a theme. There were 9 teams. A group of judges drawn from the professions of engineering, arts, urban planning, K-12 education, and community agencies, evaluated these Apps and ranked them at the end of the 3 weeks. Students were given 12 minutes to present, with 3 minutes for Q&A. The material documented here consists of their Processing and Java code, graphic assets, storyboard and Balsamiq mockups, Powerpoint/ Prezi slides, a 5 page paper, and a 2 to 3 minute marketing video. You are welcome to use any of the material provided here. Please acknowledge so others can find here any other information that they need. We were helped by the generosity of others and we wish to continue the tradition. Thank you!
